# Password-Manager-Program
A simple means of generating and recalling passwords - with user interface

User interface window, generated with tkinter, pops up and gives the user the option to enter in a new username, password, and the name of the website it is for.
The program can auto generate a password string from numbers, letter, and special characters. The generate button also copies the password to the clipboard. 

For items the user has already entered, type the name of the website into the entry box and click search. It is not case sensitive. If that entry exists, a popup window
comes up with the details, and automatically copies the password to the clipboard
